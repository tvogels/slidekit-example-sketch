# Minimal example slides for SlideKit (Sketch)

This is a minimal example project of slides built with [SlideKit](https://github.com/tvogels/slidekit).

This example uses [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) to draw the slides, and imports the Sketch file directly. 
If you use another editor, you can import `*.svg` instead of `slides.sketch` in `index.js`.

- Install [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run watch`
- Browse to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234), for the best results in Chrome.
- Open presenter mode with `[P]` or fullscreen with `[F]`.
- Your slides should auto-reload when you save the slides in Sketch.
